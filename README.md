# Rock Paper Spock


This site has been designed to target a younger audience during those in-between study times when they need to burn off some steam. It is a variant of the popular Rock-Paper-Scissors game with a twist that youngsters of all ages can enjoy. 

The user faces off against the maschine in this game of chance, and everything is simple and easy to navigate and understand. The colors chosen were intended to be relaxing and communicate low pressure. Just a fun way to cool off the brain for a few minutes.
